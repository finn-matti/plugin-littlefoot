# plugin-bigfoot

Adds Littlefoot.js to any Micro.blog

## Description

[Littlefoot](https://littlefoot.js.org) makes footnotes easy to read, in line, by having them pop up in a small bubble rather than linking through superscript numbers and return links with content posted at the end of your post.

This plugin includes the Littlefoot code in your `<head>` and calls the library so that you see fancy footnotes where javascript is enabled.

## Usage

There is no change in usage to have Littlefoot work with your posts. Just write footnotes like normal (`[^footnoteid]` in line, with a reference `[^footnoteid]: Text for footnote content` elsewhere on its own newline) and you will see the right thing on your site.
