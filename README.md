# plugin-bigfoot

Adds Bigfoot.js to any Micro.blog

## Description

[Bigfoot](http://www.bigfootjs.com) makes footnotes easy to read, in line, by having them pop up in a small bubble rather than linking through superscript numbers and return links with content posted at the end of your post.

This plugin includes the Bigfoot code in your `<head>` and calls the library so that you see fancy footnotes where javascript is enabled.

## Usage

There is no change in usage to have Bigfoot work with your posts. Just write footnotes like normal (`[^footnoteid]` in line, with a reference `[^footnoteid]: Text for footnote content` elsewhere on its own newline) and you will see the right thing on your site.
